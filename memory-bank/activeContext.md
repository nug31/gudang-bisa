# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
Implementing cPanel database connectivity and verifying API functionality in production-like environment

## Recent Changes
1. Updated `.env` to use real database: `USE_MOCK_DB=false`
2. Created comprehensive memory bank documentation:
   - projectbrief.md
   - productContext.md
   - systemPatterns.md
   - techContext.md
3. Attempted running cPanel-ready server with real database configuration

## Next Steps
1. Verify cPanel database connection by accessing `/api/try-cpanel` endpoint
2. Test database schema with `/api/test-connection` endpoint
3. Validate user registration flow with real database
4. Test category and request management APIs
5. Implement error handling improvements for database connection failures

## Active Decisions & Considerations
1. **Database Connection Strategy**
   - Current implementation allows seamless switching between mock and real database
   - Connection pooling configured for production readiness
   - Environment variables control database mode and credentials

2. **API Endpoint Validation**
   - Need to verify all endpoints work with real database
   - Focus on request management and category operations
   - Prioritize error handling and input validation checks

3. **cPanel Specific Requirements**
   - Ensure compatibility with cPanel's MySQL configuration
   - Verify connection pool settings work within cPanel constraints
   - Test error handling for common cPanel database connection issues

## Learnings & Insights
1. Application architecture supports easy switching between development and production environments
2. Current implementation includes comprehensive error handling and logging
3. API design follows RESTful patterns with consistent request validation
4. Security measures include password hashing and role-based access control

## Pending Tasks
1. Complete cPanel database connection verification
2. Test all API endpoints with real database
3. Implement any necessary adjustments for cPanel compatibility
4. Document API endpoints and usage patterns
5. Prepare deployment instructions for cPanel environment

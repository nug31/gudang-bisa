# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
This inventory request management system was created to streamline the process of requesting and tracking inventory items within an organization. The system addresses several key problems:

1. **Manual Request Process**: Previously, inventory requests were handled through paper forms or email, leading to inefficiencies and lost requests.
2. **Lack of Visibility**: Managers had no centralized view of inventory requests, making it difficult to track status and manage approvals.
3. **Inventory Management Issues**: There was no systematic way to track inventory levels or associate requests with specific inventory items.
4. **Role-Based Access Needs**: Different users (regular users, managers, administrators) needed different levels of access to the system.

## How It Should Work
The system should provide a seamless experience for users to:

1. Register and log in with role-based access
2. Create inventory requests that are associated with specific inventory items
3. Track request status through various stages (pending, approved, rejected, fulfilled)
4. Manage categories that organize inventory items
5. Allow managers to approve/reject requests
6. Maintain proper inventory stock levels when requests are fulfilled

## User Experience Goals
1. **Intuitive Interface**: Users should be able to create and track requests with minimal training
2. **Responsive Design**: The system should work well on both desktop and mobile devices
3. **Real-time Updates**: Users should see immediate feedback when creating or updating requests
4. **Clear Status Indicators**: Visual cues should make it easy to understand request status
5. **Efficient Approval Process**: Managers should be able to quickly review and act on pending requests

## Key Business Requirements
1. **Audit Trail**: Maintain a record of all request changes and status updates
2. **Inventory Accuracy**: Ensure inventory levels are accurately updated when requests are fulfilled
3. **Security**: Protect sensitive data with proper authentication and authorization
4. **Scalability**: Support growth in users, inventory items, and requests
5. **cPanel Compatibility**: Ensure the system works reliably in cPanel hosting environments

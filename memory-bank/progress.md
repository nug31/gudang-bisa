# Progress Documentation

## Current Status
- ✅ Memory Bank initialized with core documentation files
- ✅ Project configuration updated to use real database
- ✅ cPanel-ready server started successfully
- ✅ Application architecture documented in detail
- ✅ Technical requirements and constraints captured

## What Works
1. **Database Connection Switching**
   - Successfully configured to use real database via USE_MOCK_DB=false
   - Connection pooling implemented for production readiness
   - Mock database still available for development

2. **Server Implementation**
   - cPanel-ready server running on port 3001
   - Comprehensive error handling in place
   - Environment-based configuration working

3. **API Structure**
   - RESTful API endpoints following consistent patterns
   - Request validation implemented in critical endpoints
   - Error handling with appropriate status codes

4. **Security Features**
   - Password hashing with bcryptjs
   - Role-based access control (user, manager, admin)
   - Sensitive configuration stored in environment variables

## What's Left to Build
1. **cPanel Database Verification**
   - Need to verify database connection via /api/try-cpanel endpoint
   - Test database schema with /api/test-connection
   - Validate user registration flow with real database

2. **API Endpoint Testing**
   - Test category management API with real database
   - Test request management API with real database
   - Verify all endpoints work with production database

3. **Error Handling Improvements**
   - Implement additional error handling for database connection failures
   - Enhance error logging for cPanel-specific issues
   - Improve error responses for client applications

4. **Documentation**
   - Create detailed API documentation
   - Document deployment process for cPanel environment
   - Add usage examples for key endpoints

## Known Issues
1. **Database Connection**
   - Need to verify if the cPanel database connection is actually working
   - Should test with different connection scenarios (success, failure, timeout)

2. **Schema Validation**
   - Need to confirm database schema matches application expectations
   - Should verify table structures and relationships

3. **Environment Configuration**
   - Should double-check all environment variables for cPanel compatibility
   - Need to ensure database credentials are properly configured

## Evolution of Project Decisions
1. **Initial Development Phase**
   - Started with mock database for rapid development
   - Implemented core API endpoints for user management
   - Focused on frontend development with Vite and React

2. **Production Readiness Phase**
   - Added cPanel-compatible database connection
   - Implemented connection pooling for better performance
   - Enhanced error handling for production environment
   - Created comprehensive documentation

3. **Current Phase (Verification)**
   - Focusing on verifying database connection
   - Testing API endpoints with real database
   - Improving error handling and logging
   - Preparing for cPanel deployment
